# ULTRADEATH
This mod aims to recreate the [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/) death animation in Minecraft!

![Death Animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b469512-4773-4498-b330-f34c59e0f5b9)

It has all the part of the actual animation like the shader effect, sound effects, and the respawn mechanic. 


### More Versions
I might release more versions if im motivated to, but since it requires [Veil](https://modrinth.com/mod/veil/versions) to run it is tied to what veil versions there are.
